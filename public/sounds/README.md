# Sound Files for Pong

The following sound files are used in the Pong game:

1. `paddle-hit.mp3` - Played when the ball bounces off a paddle
2. `wall-hit.mp3` - Played when the ball bounces off the top or bottom wall
3. `score.mp3` - Played when a player scores a point

## Adding Real Sound Files

Replace these placeholder files with real audio files:

1. Format: MP3 files with short durations (0.1-0.5 seconds recommended)
2. Keep the filenames the same
3. Make sure the audio files are small in size (less than 100KB each is recommended)
